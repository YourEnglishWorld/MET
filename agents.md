## Results Screen

### UI Structure

**Logo:** `data/images/yew logo png.png` - Same size as Home (80px)

**Header:** "¡Test completado!" (below logo)

**Score Display:** Large blue gradient text showing percentage and fraction
- Format: `50% (3/6)` or `100% (4/4)`

**Sections (in order):**
1. **WRITING** - Shows progress per part: `3/3 • 1/1`
2. **LISTENING** - Correct answers: `3/21`
3. **READING AND GRAMMAR** - Combined: `3/11`
4. **SPEAKING** - Completeness: `1/2`

**Action Buttons:**
- Home (gray, secondary)
- Enviar resultados por email (purple, primary) - Opens mailto
- Reiniciar test (gray, secondary)

### Calculation Logic

- `totalScore` = sum of correct answers across all sections
- `totalParts` = total questions/parts across all sections
- `percentage` = round((totalScore / totalParts) * 100)

**WRITING:** Uses `sectionResponses` array - counts non-empty answers per part
- Part 1 (3 questions): count answered
- Part 2 (essay): 1 if answered

**LISTENING/READING_AND_GRAMMAR:** Uses `score[section]` from quiz data

**SPEAKING:** Uses `sectionResponses` - counts completed parts

## Function Naming Convention

Use generic names that apply to all sections:
- `sectionResponses` (not `writingResponses`)
- `currentGroup` (not `writingGroup`)
- `partCount`/`partAnswered` (not `task1Count`/`task2Count`)
- `showResults()` - handles multiple sections
- `showWritingResults()` - handles Writing only

Use section-specific names only where the functionality IS section-specific:
- `renderWritingTask1()`, `renderWritingTask2()` - specific to Writing
- `.writing-textarea` - specific ID/CSS class

### Navigation and Buttons in MET Quiz

Button PREVIOUS (ANTERIOR):
- Location: in all questions/groups of a section, except the first one.
- Function: goes back to the previous question/group, even if it requires moving back to a previous Part/Task.
- Note: in groups of questions, only one button per group.

Button NEXT (SIGUIENTE) / FINISH (FINALIZAR) (unified):
- Normal state: shows "Next" and moves to the next question/part/task.
- Special state: in the last question/group of the section, changes to "Finish section" with primary style and redirects to the section preview (#/[section-name]/preview).
- Note: never redirects to Results or another section. In groups, only one button per group.

Button SKIP TO:
- Location: in all questions/groups except the last one of the section.
- Function: redirects to the next Part of the section.
- In the last Part: shows "Skip to Preview" and redirects to the section preview.
- Label: dynamic, "Skip to [next block name]" obtained from the data array (no hardcoding).
- Note: in groups of questions, only one button per group.

Button CHECK (COMPROBAR):
- Location: in MC individual questions (below each question) or in groups (one button per group).
- Initial state: only CHECK is visible.
- On click: highlights correct answers in blue, incorrect ones in gray, updates the response counter in localStorage, hides CHECK, and shows NEXT/FINISH in the same place.

Button CONFIRM (CONFIRMAR):
- Location: only in the preview of any section.
- Function: redirects to the results page (#/results) using ShowResults().

Visual placement:
- Desktop:
  - Left → PREVIOUS
  - Center → NEXT/FINISH and CHECK
  - Right → SKIP TO
  - If SKIP does not apply, NEXT/FINISH moves to the right.
- Mobile:
  - First row → PREVIOUS (left), NEXT/FINISH (right)
  - Second row → SKIP TO (right, dynamic label) and CHECK (center)
  - Long labels (e.g., Skip to Part 2) may wrap into two lines.

### Response Tracking System

What counts as a response:
- MC: correctly answered questions.
- Writing: any textarea with written text.
- Speaking: any question with audio captured.

Preview:
- Must display all questions with their status:
  - Correctly answered
  - Wrong
  - Skipped/not answered

Results:
- Only counts correct answers.
- Does not add wrong or skipped ones.

Home (progress percentage):
- Under each section name, show a progress percentage.
- Calculation: considers all answered questions (correct or wrong).
- Skipped/not answered questions are not counted.
- Example: if a section has 10 questions and the user answered 7 (even if 3 are wrong), progress shows 70%.
