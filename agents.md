## Results Screen

### UI Structure

**Logo:** `data/images/yew logo png.png` - Same size as Home (80px)

**Header:** "¡Test completado!" (below logo)

**Score Display:** Large blue gradient text showing percentage and fraction
- Format: `50% (3/6)` or `100% (4/4)`

**Sections (in order):**
1. **WRITING** - Shows progress per part: `3/3 • 1/1`
2. **LISTENING** - Correct answers: `3/21`
3. **READING AND GRAMMAR** - Combined: `3/11`
4. **SPEAKING** - Completeness: `1/2`

**Action Buttons:**
- Home (gray, secondary)
- Enviar resultados por email (purple, primary) - Opens mailto
- Reiniciar test (gray, secondary)

### Calculation Logic

- `totalScore` = sum of correct answers across all sections
- `totalParts` = total questions/parts across all sections
- `percentage` = round((totalScore / totalParts) * 100)

**WRITING:** Uses `sectionResponses` array - counts non-empty answers per part
- Part 1 (3 questions): count answered
- Part 2 (essay): 1 if answered

**LISTENING/READING_AND_GRAMMAR:** Uses `score[section]` from quiz data

**SPEAKING:** Uses `sectionResponses` - counts completed parts

## Function Naming Convention

Use generic names that apply to all sections:
- `sectionResponses` (not `writingResponses`)
- `currentGroup` (not `writingGroup`)
- `partCount`/`partAnswered` (not `task1Count`/`task2Count`)
- `showResults()` - handles multiple sections
- `showWritingResults()` - handles Writing only

Use section-specific names only where the functionality IS section-specific:
- `renderWritingTask1()`, `renderWritingTask2()` - specific to Writing
- `.writing-textarea` - specific ID/CSS class
